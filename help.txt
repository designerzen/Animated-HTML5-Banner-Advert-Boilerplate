Firstly _ensure that you have editted the config.json_ with your appropriate settings.
Pay close attention to types (remove any that don't apply) and variants...
And add as many variants as you wish (these are the duplicate templates named accordingly)

Types are the required sizes for the campaign. You can use any of the following :


Variants can be anything you want but primarily are useful for creating language variants

> eg. 'en', 'th', 'hk', 'de'

If you have common elements on all of your pages, you can edit the **template.jade partial** as these will be cloned into your templates. 

You can use the shortcut **#{type}** wherever you want to have type specific elements (mpu/skyscraper/banner etc).
The shortcuts **#{width}** and **#{height}** are also available if you wish to use them!

Then run :

> gulp scaffold

to create both jade template files for adding in your content, and a project manifest for each size.

NB. if you just want jade (templates) or javascript manifests

> gulp templates

> gulp manifest


###To Build For _Testing_###

> gulp build


###To Compile For Release to _Creatives_###

This creates a minified version that allows creatives to test the varieties easily while retaining a single folder structure

> gulp compile


###To Compile For _Distribution_###

Compiling creates a **Release** folder that contains X folders _(per campaign)_
  
> gulp distribute
    
As well as **one ZIP file that represents one release folder** in the format
The filesize is displayed in the console when run.

release / **Name-Type-Variant.zip**

Where **Name**, **Type** and **Variant**  are read in from the **package.json** file

_eg. Kittens-mpu-a.zip_

Uploading your advert to agencies usually requires a zip file with the campaign inside - these are those files.
